## How do I get a list of certificates?

```console
# kubectl get certificate --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE          NAME                            AGE
default            example-com                     13m
```

## What types of certificates are supported?

Currently, the module supports the following two ClusterIssuers:
* letsencrypt
* letsencrypt-staging

## Does the legacy tls-acme annotation work?

Yes, it works! The dedicated component (`cert-manager-ingress-shim`) automatically creates `Certificate` resources based on these annotations (in the same namespaces as those of Ingress resources with annotations).

**Caution!** The Certificate for a particular annotation is linked to the existing Ingress resource. The additional records are put into the existing Ingress resource instead of creating a separate one. Thus, the process will fail if authentication or whitelist is set for the primary Ingress. In this case, you shouldn't use the annotation; use the Certificate instead.

**Caution!** If you switched to the Certificate instead of annotation, then you need to delete the annotation-based Certificate. Otherwise, the same Secret will be updated for both Certificates (this may lead to exceeding the Let's Encrypt limits).

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"           # here is the annotation!
  name: example-com
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: site
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  - host: www.example.com                    # the additional domain
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: site
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  - host: admin.example.com                  # another additional domain
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: site
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - example.com
    - www.example.com                        # the additional domain
    - admin.example.com                      # another additional domain
    secretName: example-com-tls              # the name of the certificate & secret
```

## The "CAA record does not match issuer" error

Suppose `cert-manager` gets the following error when trying to provide a certificate:

```
CAA record does not match issuer
```

In this case, you have to check the `CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization)` DNS record of the domain for which the certificate is intended. For Let's Encrypt certificates, the domain must have the `issue "letsencrypt.org"` CAA record. You can read more about CAA [here](https://www.xolphin.com/support/Terminology/CAA_DNS_Records) and [here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/).
